## Neovim Setup

This repository contains all my
personal Neovim setup files. Feel
free to clone the repo to save time
when setting up Neovim yourself.

I must give credit to Josean Martinez,
who has an amazing blog and YouTube
channel that walks through the full
setup process. His GitHub is below:

There are a lot of docs here, but
that is because Neovim is fully
customizable.
